0 1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 
1 21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. 
0 1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. 
1 7:1 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. 
0 28:12 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it. 
1 10:5 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, 
0 21:18 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation. 
1 2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations: 
0 17:6 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee. 
1 5:10 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.
